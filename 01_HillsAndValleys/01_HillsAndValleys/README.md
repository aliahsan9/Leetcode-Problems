# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Practice in C#

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! 💻  
Here, I solve **daily LeetCode problems** using **C#**, improving my algorithmic thinking and coding skills one day at a time.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each problem is stored in its own folder, named sequentially for clarity and consistency:


- Each folder is a separate **.NET Console Project** created using:  
  `dotnet new console -n ProblemName`
- All problem files are clean, self-contained, and easy to run and understand.

- .NET 8 Console App
- Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio
- Git & GitHub
